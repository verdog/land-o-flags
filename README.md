# Land O' Flags

Land O' Flags is my submission to [CCAWJAM3](https://itch.io/jam/ccawjam-3).

## Technical info

Land O' Flags was made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) 3.2 on Linux. You should be able to import the project into the engine using the files in this repository. On the projects list screen in Godot (the screen the engine starts at upon startup) select "Import" and choose the `project.godot` file that is in this directory.

## Directory Structure

This was a game jam game, so the directory structure is messy, there are some unused files lying around, and the code has almost zero explanation or comments. Sorry! That being said, here is roughly what is in each folder.

### art

Game art - sprites, tilesets, buttons, etc.

### fonts

Godot font themes and ttf files.

### other

Just has a (very outdated an incorrect) todo list.

### scenes

All Godot scenes and `.gd` files.

### sound

Sound effects and music.
